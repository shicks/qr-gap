# qr-gap

An end-to-end system for transmitting files over an air gap using QR codes.

This system has two parts: (1) a terminal program that displays a sequence
of QR codes, and (2) a web page that reads the QR codes (locally, in the
browser) and saves the files.

Note: much of the receiving logic is forked from
[xulihang/barcode-detection-api-demo][1].
